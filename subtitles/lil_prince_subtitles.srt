1
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:04,963
Once, when I was six years old,
I read a book about a primeval forest.

2
00:01:07,803 --> 00:01:09,133
The book said,

3
00:01:09,263 --> 00:01:13,193
"Boa constrictors swallow
their prey whole, without chewing it."

4
00:01:17,173 --> 00:01:22,013
I pondered this deeply.
And then, I made my first drawing.

5
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:25,553
I showed my masterpiece to grown-ups

6
00:01:25,683 --> 00:01:28,103
and asked if the drawing
frightened them.

7
00:01:28,183 --> 00:01:29,263
Frightened?

8
00:01:29,353 --> 00:01:32,143
Why should anyone
be frightened of a hat?

9
00:01:32,233 --> 00:01:33,812
Grown-ups.

10
00:01:33,982 --> 00:01:36,312
They never understand
anything by themselves.

11
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:39,822
So, I made another drawing.

12
00:01:40,902 --> 00:01:43,612
Yes.
- My advice is stick to arithmetic.

13
00:01:43,692 --> 00:01:45,992
- History.
- And grammar.

14
00:01:46,662 --> 00:01:50,332
I took their advice and I grew up.

15
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:54,542
I forgot all about being a child.

16
00:01:55,502 --> 00:01:58,712
Until something miraculous happened.

17
00:02:12,722 --> 00:02:15,892
The Little Prince

18
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:26,652
I've always wanted to find someone
to share his story with, but...

19
00:02:26,742 --> 00:02:28,662
I don't know...

20
00:02:28,742 --> 00:02:32,082
I guess this world just got too grown-up.

21
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:40,081
Good morning. let's recap today's recap
of today's market activity.

22
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:42,961
Record-breaking numbers
were written down on pieces of paper,

23
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:46,211
taken to the bank,
placed in drawers and locked with keys.

24
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:50,091
Back straight.

25
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:52,221
Listening attentively.

26
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:53,761
Listening.

27
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:56,771
No excessive blinking.

28
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:59,021
Listening.

29
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:01,481
Unexpected praise.

30
00:03:01,611 --> 00:03:04,731
Acknowledge and thank you.

31
00:03:05,481 --> 00:03:08,401
It's a smile, sweetie. Show your teeth.

32
00:03:08,611 --> 00:03:10,781
Not too much.

33
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,741
Good. Okay.

34
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:14,621
Now remember,

35
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:18,081
Excerpt polling historical data tell us that if the panel
is leaning toward acceptance,

36
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:20,211
they will ask only one question.

37
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,331
The big question.

38
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:24,841
Are you Werth Academy material?

39
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:27,801
Yes I am.

40
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:30,931
Three things make me Werth Academy Material...

41
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:39,671
Zero-one-seven?

42
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,590
Go on.

43
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,860
We've reviewed your application.

44
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,740
Thank you!

45
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,740
We've reviewed your transcripts...

46
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,990
Thank... You.

47
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,250
We've read your essay,

48
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,250
"The transformative power of zero
on the bottom line"

49
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,840
and the follow-up, "Zero, still my hero."

50
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,430
Yes. We do that everything
looks to be in place.

51
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,680
We will ask you just one question today.

52
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,190
The big question!

53
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,399
"Are you Werth Academy material?"

54
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:46,359
What will you be
when you grow up?

55
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,449
Yes I am.

56
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:53,449
Three things make me
Werth Academy material.

57
00:04:53,529 --> 00:04:54,619
No. No.

58
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:56,949
One, like Werth, I'm sensible.

59
00:04:57,119 --> 00:04:58,959
Two, like Werth, I am serious.

60
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,039
- Stop.
- Three...

61
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:02,709
Like Werth...

62
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:05,749
My unwavering...

63
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:07,709
Abort... Abort.

64
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:10,379
Concern...

65
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:12,639
learn...

66
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:17,469
Thank you.

67
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,309
Sweetie!

68
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:25,979
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE
WHEN YOU GROW UP?

69
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:27,439
ESSENTIAL.

70
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:36,119
Apparently,
they changed the big question.

71
00:05:38,499 --> 00:05:40,119
I'm sorry, Mum.

72
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:42,119
Don't be.

73
00:05:42,629 --> 00:05:44,249
We'll just have to go to Plan B.

74
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:45,318
"B"?

75
00:05:45,398 --> 00:05:47,318
You said Plan B was impossible!

76
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:48,648
That's why we went with Plan A.

77
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:51,238
Plan B is the new Plan A.

78
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:54,408
We're moving forward!

79
00:05:55,908 --> 00:05:57,358
Neighbourhood identified. Check.

80
00:05:57,448 --> 00:06:00,868
If by some miracle we can find a house
in the neighborhood we can afford

81
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:02,478
they may have to take you.

82
00:06:03,118 --> 00:06:04,908
REDUCED PRICE HOUSE FOR SALE

83
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:07,788
Check. Check.

84
00:06:10,298 --> 00:06:12,208
Moving truck, check.

85
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:13,848
FIRST DAY OF SUMMER HOLIDAYS

86
00:06:13,928 --> 00:06:16,558
Matters of consequence today for
the serious and sensible man...

87
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:18,218
We did it!

88
00:06:18,388 --> 00:06:21,218
You're going to Werth Academy
whether they like it or not.

89
00:06:21,638 --> 00:06:25,598
Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive,
it comes to the same thing for us.

90
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:31,398
No one is ever satisfied
where he is, pursuing nothing...

91
00:06:34,678 --> 00:06:37,298
Our new home. Check.

92
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:59,077
Is it too late for a Plan C?

93
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:05,077
Just keep reminding yourself that
that house made this house available,

94
00:07:05,537 --> 00:07:07,577
and made your future possible.

95
00:07:26,097 --> 00:07:27,227
Mum?

96
00:07:34,197 --> 00:07:36,777
Do you really think
I'm Werth Academy material?

97
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:40,277
You will be by the end of the summer.
because I have designed a plan.

98
00:07:41,907 --> 00:07:42,947
Right on time.

99
00:07:44,957 --> 00:07:47,617
I call it your life plan.

100
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:49,126
My life plan?

101
00:07:52,456 --> 00:07:54,046
Your life plan.

102
00:07:54,126 --> 00:07:56,796
We're not leaving anything to chance.

103
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:59,926
Everything's here.
From top to bottom. Left to right.

104
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:01,556
Let's take a look.

105
00:08:01,806 --> 00:08:04,466
The minute of the hour,
hour of the day, day of the week,

106
00:08:04,556 --> 00:08:07,806
week of the month, month of the year,
the year of your life.

107
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:09,896
Everything! Got it?

108
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:16,316
It's even got a chart
for all your birthday gifts.

109
00:08:16,446 --> 00:08:18,986
Like your ninth birthday,
coming up. Microscope.

110
00:08:19,116 --> 00:08:21,616
Perfect for
the Werth Academy biology curriculum.

111
00:08:21,826 --> 00:08:23,326
It's already wrapped.

112
00:08:23,446 --> 00:08:25,496
- Wow.
- Yes.

113
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:28,826
But for now,
All your attention should be focused here

114
00:08:29,286 --> 00:08:31,286
The first day of your new school.

115
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,666
We've got 53 days to go,
which doesn't sound like much,

116
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:38,836
until you break it into hours, 1,272.

117
00:08:38,966 --> 00:08:41,506
Or minutes, 76,320.

118
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:44,926
Only then do you realise
how much can be accomplished.

119
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:48,686
You will use those minutes,
hours and days according to this.

120
00:08:48,806 --> 00:08:50,765
Because, let's face it,

121
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,265
you're going to be all alone out there.

122
00:08:54,685 --> 00:08:55,855
All alone.

123
00:08:57,985 --> 00:08:59,525
So...

124
00:08:59,655 --> 00:09:02,025
We can't afford any more mistakes,
like the interview.

125
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:03,155
Right.

126
00:09:04,195 --> 00:09:07,535
You're going to make
a wonderful grown-up.

127
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:09,035
Thank you, Mum.

128
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:14,525
I wish I could stay, sweetie,
but it's the Davis audit, again.

129
00:09:14,605 --> 00:09:17,195
Kelly's numbers on
the Miller account are problematic.

130
00:09:17,275 --> 00:09:20,115
Fines found out
and now Logan's in a panic.

131
00:09:20,615 --> 00:09:21,615
Fisher wants nothing to do with it...

132
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:22,785
Logan.

133
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:25,205
- So I've got to go...
- And put it right.

134
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:27,955
Yes, but I'm not even sure
that's possible.

135
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,955
If anyone can do it, it's you. Go on.

136
00:09:31,085 --> 00:09:32,745
I've got my life plan!

137
00:09:33,085 --> 00:09:34,875
You're my senior VP.

138
00:09:46,385 --> 00:09:47,435
Let's do it.

139
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,304
Gas.

140
00:11:08,553 --> 00:11:10,883
Anybody home?

141
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:17,643
Bolts...

142
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:38,913
I didn't actually believe
he had a plane back there.

143
00:11:39,043 --> 00:11:41,833
I think the old guy flew away years ago.

144
00:11:41,923 --> 00:11:44,673
I'm just thankful
we don't live next door to him.

145
00:11:46,383 --> 00:11:47,503
Roger that.

146
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:56,668
Oh!

147
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:58,022
Well hello there.

148
00:11:59,722 --> 00:12:01,642
A very good afternoon to you, Officer.

149
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:03,572
Friends!

150
00:12:09,872 --> 00:12:13,252
I was just...
I was immersed in a game of bridge.

151
00:12:13,872 --> 00:12:15,042
Do you play?

152
00:12:20,052 --> 00:12:24,552
Sir, did you try to start your plane again?

153
00:12:28,262 --> 00:12:30,102
Yes, I did.

154
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:33,432
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

155
00:12:33,772 --> 00:12:37,602
I do believe I have caused extensive damage
to the house next door.

156
00:12:38,862 --> 00:12:40,232
Handcuffs?

157
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:42,282
I'd rather not.

158
00:12:42,532 --> 00:12:43,902
Hold on.

159
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:49,122
It's here, I know it's here somewhere.

160
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:51,452
Sir?

161
00:12:54,292 --> 00:12:55,622
Found it.

162
00:12:57,082 --> 00:12:58,292
Found it!

163
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:00,711
Sir...

164
00:13:12,431 --> 00:13:14,981
Sweetie, I'm home. I brought Chinese.

165
00:13:15,271 --> 00:13:16,641
Mum?

166
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:17,771
Hello.

167
00:13:18,561 --> 00:13:20,151
Hi.

168
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:24,991
Where did you get the pennies?

169
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:27,241
The old man next door.

170
00:13:29,071 --> 00:13:32,991
Actually, it was the police officer
who "gave" them to me.

171
00:13:33,661 --> 00:13:34,751
What?

172
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:42,501
What kind of a nut keeps an aeroplane,
and actually starts it, in his backyard?

173
00:13:43,131 --> 00:13:44,761
Are you sure you're okay?

174
00:13:46,131 --> 00:13:47,931
- I have to call the insurance.
- Done.

175
00:13:48,011 --> 00:13:50,341
- And file a police report.
- Done. In duplicate.

176
00:13:50,471 --> 00:13:52,761
- Photo documentation?
- Inside and outside.

177
00:13:52,851 --> 00:13:54,851
The lighting could have been better.

178
00:13:56,021 --> 00:13:57,021
It's not so bad.

179
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,200
I'll call a contractor in the morning
and we'll forget the old man even exists.

180
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,820
I've already forgotten him.

181
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,200
Matters of consequence,

182
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:15,790
let's recap today's recap,
of today's market activity,

183
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:18,790
with a detailed account...
Numbers of the day.

184
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,840
There are also hundreds of others...

185
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,519
"Once upon a time there was
a little prince who lived on a planet"

186
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:25,939
"that was scarcely bigger than himself,
and who had need of..."

187
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:27,069
A friend?

188
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:29,439
I thought you could use a friend!

189
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:33,279
No, here I am, up here.

190
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,239
Here! Hi.

191
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,619
I'm sorry.
That's just the beginning of the story.

192
00:15:41,749 --> 00:15:44,289
It's okay. Nobody understands it anyway.

193
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,249
All right, bye-bye.

194
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:48,629
See you later, maybe.

195
00:15:55,969 --> 00:15:57,469
She made the most frightful noise.

196
00:15:57,599 --> 00:15:59,469
It resounded all over the place.

197
00:16:07,479 --> 00:16:10,778
- Maybe during lunch...
- I can count the pennies.

198
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:44,666
Once upon a time
there was a little prince

199
00:18:44,696 --> 00:18:47,806
who lived on a planet
that was scarcely bigger than himself,

200
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:49,596
and who had need of a friend.

201
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,946
"And I, I lived my life alone
without anyone I could really talk to."

202
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:12,666
"So I learned to pilot aeroplanes."

203
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:32,645
I flew more or less all over the world,

204
00:19:32,675 --> 00:19:36,775
until I had an accident
in the Sahara desert.

205
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:46,484
If you please, draw me a sheep!

206
00:20:50,084 --> 00:20:52,464
If you please, draw me a sheep.

207
00:21:00,224 --> 00:21:01,884
Draw me a sheep!

208
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:06,644
When a mystery is too over-powering,
one dare not disobey.

209
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:09,774
Draw? I don't know how to draw.

210
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,104
That doesn't matter.

211
00:21:14,814 --> 00:21:17,154
The first sheep I drew was too sickly.

212
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:21,283
And the second one,
not to his liking either.

213
00:21:22,403 --> 00:21:24,413
You see yourself
that this is not a sheep.

214
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,823
This is a ram, it has horns.

215
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:30,123
- And this one was...
- Too old!

216
00:21:32,963 --> 00:21:36,423
I want a sheep
that will live for a long time.

217
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:41,463
So, I drew this.

218
00:21:45,343 --> 00:21:47,143
The sheep you ask for is inside.

219
00:21:49,013 --> 00:21:51,023
That is exactly the way I wanted it!

220
00:21:53,523 --> 00:21:56,163
Do you think this sheep
will eat a great deal of grass?

221
00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:59,773
Because where I live,
everything is very small.

222
00:22:00,693 --> 00:22:03,113
Well, I'm sure there will be
enough grass for him.

223
00:22:03,193 --> 00:22:04,653
He's a very small sheep.

224
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:08,043
Not so small that...
Look! He's gone to sleep.

225
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,492
Wow.

226
00:23:23,732 --> 00:23:25,031
Hello?

227
00:23:35,301 --> 00:23:36,341
Hello?

228
00:23:37,411 --> 00:23:38,501
Hello!

229
00:23:47,381 --> 00:23:49,221
Hold on. Don't move.

230
00:23:53,851 --> 00:23:55,261
Yeah.

231
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:56,931
Here we go.

232
00:23:58,771 --> 00:23:59,811
Wow.

233
00:24:22,291 --> 00:24:26,001
I... I just wanted to give
your drawing back.

234
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,170
Oh, you didn't like it?

235
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,050
No, no I did.

236
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,630
It's not very good.

237
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,050
I think it's nice.

238
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,600
I read the story, too. Attentively.

239
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:39,100
And I found it quite odd.

240
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,930
Odd?

241
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,730
I mean curious... Or interesting...

242
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,270
I guess have some issues
with some of the facts.

243
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,400
You have questions?

244
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,820
I don't mean to be rude. Can I?

245
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,450
What? Be rude?
Sure, go ahead. What you got?

246
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:57,660
We, first of all, what was the kid
doing there in the desert?

247
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,790
That's very strange.

248
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,040
No one can last very long
in a desert without food and water.

249
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,960
Where are his parents?
Does he even go to school?

250
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:07,840
Does he really live up there?
I took basic astronomy

251
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,670
and there was no mention of life,
or children, on any other planets.

252
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,680
Unless... it's true
that he came from a star.

253
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,840
But that's improbable.

254
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,760
Not a star. An asteroid.

255
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,430
Asteroid B-612.

256
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,350
We didn't cover asteroids.

257
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,440
But the fact that he wanted a sheep,
that pretty much proves that he exists.

258
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:31,529
Don't you think?

259
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:41,329
Hold on, I'm just gonna find you
another drawing.

260
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:47,789
Wow.

261
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:51,419
This is a pretty serious fire hazard.

262
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:54,009
I never looked at it that way.

263
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,759
Where did you get all this stuff?

264
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,599
Oh well, as you live
some things just kind of stick to you.

265
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:03,269
There's a name for it...

266
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:04,769
- Collecting?
- Hoarding!

267
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:06,559
That's it, hoarding.

268
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,439
That's what I am - a hoarder.
A minimal hoarder.

269
00:26:13,569 --> 00:26:15,239
What's your name, little fox?

270
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:17,609
He can't answer you.

271
00:26:17,699 --> 00:26:20,329
I keep meaning to sew him a mouth.

272
00:26:33,588 --> 00:26:36,338
Are you okay? You're okay?

273
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,928
I'm fine, this happens sometimes.

274
00:26:39,428 --> 00:26:40,638
Just give me a minute.

275
00:26:40,718 --> 00:26:43,808
Though the last time this happened,
I was down here for three days.

276
00:26:43,888 --> 00:26:45,308
- Three days?
- That's okay.

277
00:26:45,388 --> 00:26:49,228
That's why I always keep
a sandwich in my pocket.

278
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:50,768
Want a bite? Baloney.

279
00:26:51,518 --> 00:26:54,188
I think I'm baloney intolerant.

280
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:56,488
I think it's baloney.

281
00:27:01,198 --> 00:27:03,538
It's gonna be a clear night.

282
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,628
The stars will be out soon.

283
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,468
Wow.

284
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:24,718
The Little Prince,
he was very fond of sunsets.

285
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:27,978
One day he saw 44 of them.

286
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:29,688
What?

287
00:27:29,768 --> 00:27:31,978
His planet, it was so small,

288
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:35,977
all he had to do was move his chair
a few steps to see another one.

289
00:27:37,487 --> 00:27:40,817
But a small planet also had drawbacks.

290
00:27:41,237 --> 00:27:44,577
He needed
a sheep to eat the baobab sprouts.

291
00:27:44,947 --> 00:27:46,367
- Baobab?
- Yeah.

292
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,727
It's a very greedy tree.

293
00:27:49,207 --> 00:27:54,037
And every day, he toiled
to stop them from turning up.

294
00:27:54,167 --> 00:27:55,837
For if you intervene too late...

295
00:27:56,877 --> 00:27:58,547
Catastrophe.

296
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:02,177
Now, luckily, there are good seeds, too.

297
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:07,057
And one day, from a seed blown
from no one knew where,

298
00:28:07,427 --> 00:28:10,437
a new kind of sprout came up.

299
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,447
I know you'll be miraculous.

300
00:28:20,527 --> 00:28:22,197
I know you will.

301
00:28:38,376 --> 00:28:40,416
How beautiful you are!

302
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:42,006
I'm only half awake.

303
00:28:42,546 --> 00:28:44,676
Forgive me, I'm still quite dishevelled.

304
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:46,136
You're perfect.

305
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:47,886
Am I not?

306
00:28:48,516 --> 00:28:51,436
I was born
at the same moment as the sun.

307
00:28:56,446 --> 00:29:00,446
It was there they shared
their first sunrise

308
00:29:01,996 --> 00:29:04,706
and their first sunset.

309
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:08,586
It's very cold where you live.

310
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:17,756
Could you be kind enough
to think of my needs?

311
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:22,056
But the Rose began very quickly
to torment him with her vanity.

312
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,306
I suppose you wouldn't have a screen?

313
00:29:24,476 --> 00:29:27,146
And at night I want you
to put me under a glass.

314
00:29:27,306 --> 00:29:29,056
A glass globe, now. My needs...

315
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:30,396
My beauty... My screen...

316
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:34,276
Now, the shame of it was
that they loved each other.

317
00:29:34,896 --> 00:29:38,906
But they were both too young
to know how to love.

318
00:29:40,985 --> 00:29:44,035
Full of doubt, he ran away.

319
00:29:45,415 --> 00:29:46,955
Of course I love you.

320
00:29:47,495 --> 00:29:49,665
If you're not aware of that, it's my fault.

321
00:29:49,835 --> 00:29:51,085
Please forgive me.

322
00:30:00,305 --> 00:30:02,425
He left her? All alone?

323
00:30:03,055 --> 00:30:04,885
But where did he go?

324
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:07,805
He didn't know it at the time,

325
00:30:07,895 --> 00:30:11,475
but his leaving was just the first step
on a journey back to her.

326
00:30:11,765 --> 00:30:13,275
- Really?
- Yes.

327
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:16,735
Look at that, the stars are out.

328
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:24,445
Wow.

329
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:26,575
They're so bright.

330
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:30,165
There are so many to look at.

331
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:34,545
And on a good day, if I listen carefully,

332
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,965
I can hear him laughing up there.

333
00:30:51,804 --> 00:30:53,474
Oh no... I gotta go!

334
00:31:02,984 --> 00:31:05,324
Sweetie? Where are you?

335
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:11,494
Oh, hi!

336
00:31:12,034 --> 00:31:15,544
Your desk is a mess.
Did you finish your study work for today?

337
00:31:17,254 --> 00:31:19,754
No, not exactly.

338
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:21,674
Well, what have you been doing?

339
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,344
I read a lot...

340
00:31:25,004 --> 00:31:26,844
And I made a friend.

341
00:31:28,634 --> 00:31:29,684
A friend?

342
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,934
No. No, no, no.

343
00:31:34,514 --> 00:31:36,184
No.

344
00:31:36,814 --> 00:31:38,144
Maybe...

345
00:31:39,774 --> 00:31:41,024
Yes.

346
00:31:41,104 --> 00:31:42,194
Okay.

347
00:31:44,863 --> 00:31:45,983
FRIEND

348
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:49,613
If you study hard and you stay
completely on track with the plan,

349
00:31:49,703 --> 00:31:52,573
you can spend some time
with your new friend.

350
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:55,743
Next summer,
on Thursdays, from 1:00 to 1:30.

351
00:31:56,293 --> 00:31:58,623
Okay? Can't wait to meet her.

352
00:32:10,683 --> 00:32:13,183
"He found himself
in the neighbourhood of asteroids"

353
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:17,433
325, 326, 327,

354
00:32:17,933 --> 00:32:22,563
"328, 329, 330..."

355
00:32:25,613 --> 00:32:27,863
What?

356
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:29,903
It is a subject.

357
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,863
Approach.

358
00:32:31,953 --> 00:32:34,033
Sire, over what do you rule?

359
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:36,243
Over everything.

360
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:38,493
And the stars obey you?

361
00:32:38,583 --> 00:32:42,253
They certainly do.
I do not permit insubordination.

362
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:46,383
I would very much like to see a sunset.

363
00:32:46,463 --> 00:32:49,002
It would remind me of my rose.

364
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,052
Could you order the sun to set.

365
00:32:55,512 --> 00:32:57,392
You shall have your sunset.

366
00:32:57,472 --> 00:32:59,142
I shall command it.

367
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,432
But I shall wait
until conditions are favourable.

368
00:33:02,692 --> 00:33:03,812
When will that be?

369
00:33:05,402 --> 00:33:07,362
Well, that will be about...

370
00:33:07,442 --> 00:33:12,492
That will be... oh... this evening,
about 20 minutes to 8:00.

371
00:33:18,622 --> 00:33:20,082
Good morning.

372
00:33:20,242 --> 00:33:22,202
You're wearing a funny kind of hat.

373
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:27,082
What... It is a hat for salutes, actually.

374
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:29,592
To raise when people acclaim me.

375
00:33:31,132 --> 00:33:33,302
Clap your hands, yeah.

376
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:36,642
Thank you. Thank you.

377
00:33:36,722 --> 00:33:38,012
You see?

378
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:45,232
Do you really admire me very much?

379
00:33:46,352 --> 00:33:50,151
Am I not the handsomest,
the best-dressed, the richest...

380
00:33:50,821 --> 00:33:53,441
I'm the most intelligent man on this planet.

381
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:57,281
But you're the only man on this planet.

382
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,781
Do me this kindness and...

383
00:34:01,411 --> 00:34:04,411
Admire me just the same, please.

384
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:09,881
I own the stars...

385
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,841
I administer them.

386
00:34:11,921 --> 00:34:13,671
I count them, and I recount them.

387
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:16,341
But what good does that do you?

388
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:20,101
Well, it does me the good of making me rich.
How's that?

389
00:34:20,181 --> 00:34:22,931
And what good does it
do you to be rich?

390
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:26,181
It makes it possible for me
to buy more stars.

391
00:34:26,521 --> 00:34:29,231
Plus, anything else you can think of.

392
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:35,691
Grown-ups are certainly very,very odd.

393
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:41,831
And check. And check. And check.

394
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:44,201
Check.

395
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:45,791
Check.

396
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,041
And check. And check.

397
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:52,630
Check...

398
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:02,180
Grown-ups are certainly very, very odd.

399
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,010
I've lived a great deal among grown-ups.

400
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,350
I have seen them intimately close at hand.

401
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,940
And that hasn't much changed
my opinion of them.

402
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,980
Yes. I'm not so sure
I want to grow up any more.

403
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,320
Growing up is not the problem.

404
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,200
Forgetting is.

405
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,300
I definitely don't want to forget.

406
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,710
I managed to grow up
and I never forgot the Little Prince.

407
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,760
Yeah...

408
00:36:03,999 --> 00:36:05,209
Good evening.

409
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,419
Good evening.

410
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:11,969
What planet is this?

411
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:14,179
This is Earth.

412
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:15,389
This is Africa.

413
00:36:17,059 --> 00:36:18,509
Where are all the men?

414
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:21,059
It is a little lonely in the desert.

415
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,349
It is also lonely among men.

416
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:26,609
You are a funny animal.
You are no thicker than a finger.

417
00:36:29,149 --> 00:36:32,399
But I'm more powerful
than the finger of a king.

418
00:36:33,279 --> 00:36:34,529
You haven't any feet.

419
00:36:35,029 --> 00:36:36,819
You cannot even travel.

420
00:36:36,949 --> 00:36:40,329
I can carry you further
than any ship could take you.

421
00:36:43,919 --> 00:36:47,379
I can help you someday, if you
go too homesick for your home planet.

422
00:36:47,459 --> 00:36:50,169
I think I understand you.

423
00:36:54,299 --> 00:36:57,838
There you go,
try that one on the left there.

424
00:37:00,138 --> 00:37:01,468
I'm scared.

425
00:37:01,888 --> 00:37:03,808
That's normal. It is scary.

426
00:37:04,308 --> 00:37:06,558
Why do you think I sent you?

427
00:37:09,358 --> 00:37:11,688
Almost there. You got it now.

428
00:37:12,528 --> 00:37:14,148
Just reach! Reach for it!

429
00:37:15,658 --> 00:37:17,988
- I got it!
- There you go! You got it!

430
00:37:24,708 --> 00:37:26,868
Well, that was...

431
00:37:27,128 --> 00:37:28,918
That was double scary, right?

432
00:37:29,918 --> 00:37:31,708
Triple and quadruple.

433
00:37:31,798 --> 00:37:34,168
We're going to have to amputate them.

434
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:35,918
What?

435
00:37:41,848 --> 00:37:44,018
- Feels better, doesn't it?
- Yes.

436
00:37:54,068 --> 00:37:57,948
But it happened that after
walking a long time through sand,

437
00:37:58,488 --> 00:38:00,027
and rocks, and snow,

438
00:38:00,407 --> 00:38:02,197
the Fox appeared.

439
00:38:14,547 --> 00:38:16,457
Hey! Come and play with me.

440
00:38:17,217 --> 00:38:19,177
I cannot play with you.

441
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:20,887
I am not tamed.

442
00:38:21,097 --> 00:38:22,597
What does that mean?

443
00:38:23,677 --> 00:38:25,677
Tame means, "To establish ties."

444
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,517
To me, you're still nothing more
than a little boy

445
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,267
who is just like 100,000 other little boys.

446
00:38:32,017 --> 00:38:33,687
I have no need of you.

447
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:35,107
And you have no need of me.

448
00:38:35,597 --> 00:38:39,507
To you, I'm nothing more than a fox
like a hundred thousand foxes.

449
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:43,237
But if you tame me,
then we shall need each other.

450
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,426
Hey, there.

451
00:40:10,165 --> 00:40:12,965
To me,
you will be unique in all the world.

452
00:40:13,085 --> 00:40:16,745
And to you,
I shall be unique in all the world.

453
00:41:09,234 --> 00:41:10,314
Who are you?

454
00:41:10,404 --> 00:41:12,654
We are roses.

455
00:41:15,154 --> 00:41:18,114
My rose is just a common rose?

456
00:41:18,994 --> 00:41:22,704
But she told me she was the only one of
her kind in the whole universe.

457
00:41:24,164 --> 00:41:26,124
But she is not a common rose.

458
00:41:26,294 --> 00:41:27,374
She is your rose.

459
00:41:28,164 --> 00:41:31,714
The time that you have devoted to her
makes your rose so important.

460
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,544
She is my rose.

461
00:41:35,674 --> 00:41:37,014
You must return to her.

462
00:41:44,354 --> 00:41:46,774
Oh no, you're gonna cry?

463
00:41:48,184 --> 00:41:51,104
My taming you
has done you no good at all.

464
00:41:55,444 --> 00:41:57,574
Let me make you a present of a secret.

465
00:41:57,934 --> 00:42:03,944
It is only with the heart
that one can see rightly.

466
00:42:04,184 --> 00:42:08,954
What is essential is invisible to the eye.

467
00:42:11,983 --> 00:42:13,523
They won't be together any more?

468
00:42:15,313 --> 00:42:16,403
But they will.

469
00:42:17,483 --> 00:42:21,113
The Fox, he sees the Little Prince
when he looks with his heart.

470
00:42:21,653 --> 00:42:24,823
If you can do that,
you'll never be lonely again.

471
00:42:25,493 --> 00:42:29,033
Right. But I'm not lonely.
I've got you now.

472
00:42:29,953 --> 00:42:31,663
I am so lucky.

473
00:42:31,753 --> 00:42:35,413
I thought I'd never find anyone
who wanted to hear my story.

474
00:42:35,503 --> 00:42:38,423
Then you came along. Just in time.

475
00:42:40,213 --> 00:42:41,303
Wait...

476
00:42:42,553 --> 00:42:44,803
What do you mean, "Just in time"?

477
00:42:47,843 --> 00:42:52,973
Well, everyone has
to say goodbye sooner or later.

478
00:42:54,183 --> 00:42:55,353
You're leaving?

479
00:42:56,023 --> 00:42:57,603
Well...

480
00:42:57,693 --> 00:43:01,273
What if I get that old plane running?

481
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:03,863
What if it's time for me

482
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:07,243
to go be with the Little Prince?

483
00:43:08,373 --> 00:43:09,413
But...

484
00:43:09,913 --> 00:43:11,532
He already has his rose...

485
00:43:12,742 --> 00:43:14,582
And I need you here.

486
00:43:21,672 --> 00:43:23,132
Hey. Hey.

487
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:25,382
You hungry?

488
00:43:25,922 --> 00:43:27,222
I know a great place

489
00:43:27,302 --> 00:43:30,392
where we can get
free pancakes on your birthday.

490
00:43:30,892 --> 00:43:33,262
But my birthday's not for two weeks.

491
00:43:33,602 --> 00:43:34,852
They don't know that.

492
00:43:43,692 --> 00:43:45,902
It's like flying a plane.

493
00:43:48,952 --> 00:43:50,702
Like the one you crashed?

494
00:43:50,782 --> 00:43:52,032
Exactly!

495
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:38,661
Oh, what?

496
00:44:48,261 --> 00:44:50,091
Pull over.

497
00:45:02,061 --> 00:45:03,771
Do you have a driver's license?

498
00:45:03,861 --> 00:45:04,981
No.

499
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:07,731
- A learner's permit?
- No.

500
00:45:07,821 --> 00:45:08,941
How old are you?

501
00:45:09,031 --> 00:45:12,491
- Hi, Officer.
- Your car is out of the garage, again.

502
00:45:12,571 --> 00:45:13,951
Yeah...

503
00:45:14,031 --> 00:45:17,740
Good afternoon, Officer.
If I may interject for a moment...

504
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:20,290
Did you know it's my birthday?

505
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,380
- Mum, I can...
- Wait for me inside.

506
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:27,800
- But...
- Now.

507
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,130
I'm very sorry to call you at work.

508
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,140
Apparently, they were going
to get pancakes...

509
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,890
- Would you like to speak to him?
- Yes...

510
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,940
No! No, no!

511
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,570
Mr Fox!

512
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,870
According to this, you're still in bed.

513
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,330
Asleep. Yesterday.

514
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:04,040
Your "friend" doesn't even
have a driver's license.

515
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:07,080
No. They took it away
after the fourth time

516
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:10,000
he drove away
with the gas pump attached.

517
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,470
You could have been killed!

518
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:16,470
- Mum, I can explain...
- No, you mean you can lie.

519
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,140
- But...
- You've been lying to me,

520
00:46:18,259 --> 00:46:19,719
you lied to the police officer.

521
00:46:19,889 --> 00:46:22,309
And before I forget, happy birthday.

522
00:46:23,939 --> 00:46:26,479
You even managed
to lie to your life plan!

523
00:46:26,899 --> 00:46:29,479
That? It's just a board full of magnets!

524
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:31,689
You care more
about that than about me.

525
00:46:31,779 --> 00:46:33,279
You're wrong.

526
00:46:33,569 --> 00:46:36,489
I care about it
as much as I care about you.

527
00:46:37,069 --> 00:46:38,369
It is you.

528
00:46:38,449 --> 00:46:42,199
This is your life and I'm the only one
taking any responsibility for it!

529
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:46,039
That's your version of my life, not mine!

530
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:48,999
If you were ever around, you'd see that!

531
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:52,419
You know full well
why I have to work so hard.

532
00:46:53,089 --> 00:46:54,879
You're just like him now.

533
00:46:55,169 --> 00:46:57,299
Too busy, always working.

534
00:46:57,719 --> 00:46:59,759
How long until you
completely disappear?

535
00:47:05,729 --> 00:47:08,439
"I believe
that for his escape he took advantage"

536
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:11,229
"of the migration
of a flock of wild birds?"

537
00:47:11,769 --> 00:47:13,149
No, no!

538
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:15,739
Okay, enough of this nonsense.

539
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:17,949
You have two weeks to focus.

540
00:47:18,029 --> 00:47:19,359
But, Mum!

541
00:48:50,537 --> 00:48:53,457
LOVE, DAD

542
00:49:34,176 --> 00:49:36,056
Let's look for a well.

543
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:16,056
The stars are beautiful because
of a flower that cannot be seen.

544
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:27,526
What makes the desert beautiful
is that somewhere it hides a well.

545
00:50:30,115 --> 00:50:35,075
In the moonlight, I looked
at his pale forehead, his closed eyes,

546
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:38,405
his locks of hair
that trembled in the wind,

547
00:50:38,495 --> 00:50:40,245
and I said to myself,

548
00:50:40,325 --> 00:50:43,875
"What I see here is nothing but a shell."

549
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,795
"What is most important
is what is invisible."

550
00:51:01,515 --> 00:51:03,855
We found a well at daybreak.

551
00:51:10,815 --> 00:51:14,365
The men where you live
grow thousands of roses

552
00:51:14,445 --> 00:51:17,655
and they do not find
what they are looking for.

553
00:51:19,245 --> 00:51:22,995
What they are looking for
could be found in a single rose,

554
00:51:23,075 --> 00:51:24,745
or a little water.

555
00:51:56,324 --> 00:51:57,404
Hold your horses.

556
00:52:00,154 --> 00:52:02,284
Let's go look for a well.

557
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:04,324
No. Listen.

558
00:52:04,624 --> 00:52:07,204
I made a big mistake the other day.

559
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:09,754
You can't come over here any more.

560
00:52:10,004 --> 00:52:12,294
- This will be the last time.
- What?

561
00:52:12,374 --> 00:52:14,674
Let's get that plane running!

562
00:52:19,714 --> 00:52:22,764
If you managed to find a well
in the middle of the desert,

563
00:52:22,844 --> 00:52:25,224
then we can go
and find the Little Prince.

564
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,604
He'll be able to help us.

565
00:52:28,724 --> 00:52:32,524
Wait, little one. We can't just take off.

566
00:52:33,273 --> 00:52:34,443
You're right.

567
00:52:34,523 --> 00:52:36,273
We must fix that wing first.

568
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:37,613
No, no.

569
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:43,743
I'm sorry, but when
the moment does come for me to leave,

570
00:52:44,823 --> 00:52:46,413
I have to go alone.

571
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:51,333
But I won't be any trouble,

572
00:52:51,413 --> 00:52:54,213
and I won't take up much room
in the plane. I promise.

573
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:55,873
Don't go without me.

574
00:52:58,423 --> 00:53:01,763
I think it's time I told you
the end of the story.

575
00:53:06,093 --> 00:53:11,273
That evening, I finished fixing my plane
and I went to find the Little Prince.

576
00:53:11,353 --> 00:53:13,853
I shall be there tonight. Wait for me.

577
00:53:14,313 --> 00:53:16,653
You're sure I won't suffer too long?

578
00:53:27,703 --> 00:53:28,783
Did you shoot it?

579
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:31,543
No, it disappeared among the stones.

580
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:33,083
What happened?

581
00:53:33,873 --> 00:53:37,252
Somehow,
he knew that I had fixed my plane.

582
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:44,592
I, too, am going back home today.

583
00:53:44,672 --> 00:53:46,132
It is much farther.

584
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,932
It is much more difficult.

585
00:53:49,512 --> 00:53:50,802
I am afraid.

586
00:53:55,272 --> 00:53:58,482
I can't believe
I'll never hear you laugh again.

587
00:53:59,192 --> 00:54:01,232
I'm going to give you a present.

588
00:54:03,152 --> 00:54:05,862
In one of those stars, I shall be living.

589
00:54:06,532 --> 00:54:08,702
In one of them, I shall be laughing.

590
00:54:09,572 --> 00:54:12,202
And so, when you look up
at the sky at night,

591
00:54:12,492 --> 00:54:15,582
it will be as if all the
stars are laughing.

592
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,382
Tonight, do not come.

593
00:54:25,472 --> 00:54:28,512
You let him go? Not to the Snake!

594
00:54:29,802 --> 00:54:31,142
It wasn't my choice.

595
00:54:32,222 --> 00:54:34,012
It was time to say goodbye.

596
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:38,601
You understand that it is too far?

597
00:54:38,811 --> 00:54:41,981
I cannot carry this body with me.

598
00:54:42,481 --> 00:54:44,981
It will be like an old abandoned shell.

599
00:54:45,361 --> 00:54:48,111
There is nothing sad about old shells.

600
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:03,751
- There's the place.
- I shall not leave you.

601
00:55:30,571 --> 00:55:31,741
But...

602
00:55:33,411 --> 00:55:34,661
You...

603
00:55:42,330 --> 00:55:45,040
You said he's up there, didn't you?

604
00:55:45,130 --> 00:55:46,380
Back with his rose?

605
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:47,500
Well...

606
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:50,170
It is as he said.

607
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,090
I look at the stars
and I hear him laughing.

608
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,970
But you don't know for sure?

609
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:01,480
It would comfort me
very much to know for sure,

610
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:05,610
but instead,
I choose to believe he is up there.

611
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,280
Is that what you want me to do
when you go?

612
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:14,280
Just look up to the stars

613
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,200
and make-believe that you're not gone?

614
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:18,790
But...

615
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:23,210
If you look with your heart,
I'll always be with you.

616
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:28,050
Yes. Just like I know the Little Prince
will always be with his rose.

617
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,840
But you can't know for sure.

618
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:33,680
What if he's not back with his rose?

619
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,220
- What if he's all grown up and alone?
- But...

620
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:39,350
What if he's lost
and he's forgotten everything?

621
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,810
Wait. Hold on, My little girl. Hold on.

622
00:56:42,889 --> 00:56:45,189
The Little Prince will never forget.

623
00:56:45,309 --> 00:56:48,149
He'll always be up there for us,
to help us.

624
00:56:48,649 --> 00:56:51,819
I don't want his help.
I hate the Little Prince!

625
00:56:51,899 --> 00:56:54,489
I wasted my whole summer on
the Little Prince!

626
00:56:54,569 --> 00:56:57,869
I wish you had never told me
this stupid story.

627
00:57:30,689 --> 00:57:33,239
LAST DAY OF SUMMER HOLIDAYS

628
00:57:34,899 --> 00:57:38,989
The weather caused
32 people to be late for work.

629
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:42,539
Productivity decreased by 0.4%.

630
00:57:51,128 --> 00:57:52,378
What...

631
00:57:52,628 --> 00:57:53,708
Dear!

632
00:57:54,128 --> 00:57:55,218
No...

633
00:58:02,218 --> 00:58:03,598
Sweetie...

634
00:58:09,058 --> 00:58:10,938
No!

635
00:58:28,248 --> 00:58:29,498
Sweetie!

636
00:58:36,088 --> 00:58:37,088
Hey!

637
00:58:52,107 --> 00:58:54,857
Sweetie, stop!
What are you doing? Stop!

638
00:59:05,947 --> 00:59:08,367
Stop! You can't go!

639
00:59:08,617 --> 00:59:10,707
Please, I need you here!

640
00:59:11,627 --> 00:59:12,457
No!

641
00:59:12,537 --> 00:59:15,457
Please! You have to let me see him!

642
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:18,047
What happened? Will he be okay?

643
00:59:26,307 --> 00:59:27,637
So...

644
00:59:28,847 --> 00:59:32,687
Let's not forget,
tomorrow's an important day.

645
01:00:09,176 --> 01:00:11,176
The Aviator needs you.

646
01:00:13,726 --> 01:00:15,436
I'm going to find you.

647
01:01:17,165 --> 01:01:18,285
Wow.

648
01:01:44,445 --> 01:01:46,445
Do you know how to fly a plane?

649
01:01:49,775 --> 01:01:52,115
Yeah, I didn't think so.

650
01:01:53,155 --> 01:01:54,945
Okay, well...

651
01:01:59,994 --> 01:02:02,994
Yes! I can do this.

652
01:02:03,704 --> 01:02:05,124
Here, hold these.

653
01:03:25,203 --> 01:03:27,623
I think I've got the hang of it now.

654
01:03:51,563 --> 01:03:52,983
I've got you!

655
01:04:06,122 --> 01:04:07,912
Where are the stars?

656
01:04:12,382 --> 01:04:13,722
What is that?

657
01:04:17,222 --> 01:04:18,432
A star?

658
01:04:19,892 --> 01:04:22,562
Wait a minute. That's no star.

659
01:04:49,232 --> 01:04:52,062
The Aviator never mentioned this place.

660
01:04:58,612 --> 01:04:59,702
Could it be?

661
01:05:02,451 --> 01:05:03,911
It's him! It's him!

662
01:05:04,291 --> 01:05:06,121
What's he doing here?

663
01:05:07,711 --> 01:05:09,041
Buckle up.

664
01:05:24,061 --> 01:05:25,391
We need a gap.

665
01:05:29,061 --> 01:05:30,981
I think I see one up ahead.

666
01:05:37,821 --> 01:05:39,651
Prepare for landing.

667
01:05:45,161 --> 01:05:46,581
We did it!

668
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:11,640
We didn't do bad.

669
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:13,980
Look! Up there.

670
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:29,620
Step out of the vehicle.

671
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:33,290
I said step out of the vehicle.

672
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:35,960
I'm very sorry, Officer.
Let me just explain...

673
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:38,550
Keep your hands where I can see them.

674
01:06:45,180 --> 01:06:48,180
Unsafe speeding. Unsafe lane changes.

675
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:50,390
- Unsafe everything.
- What?

676
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,730
Running multiple red lights.

677
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:54,450
- I'm trying to find my friend...
- Destruction of city property.

678
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:57,150
Well, a friend of a friend.
We've never officially met.

679
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,360
No use of turn signals. No signals at all.

680
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:02,320
I'm just gonna grab him
and take him home.

681
01:07:02,860 --> 01:07:06,530
Attempted kidnapping!
Add that to the list.

682
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:08,739
Attempted kidnapping.

683
01:07:10,749 --> 01:07:12,999
Hey, are you...

684
01:07:15,329 --> 01:07:17,749
Thank you.

685
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:18,999
The Conceited Man.

686
01:07:20,419 --> 01:07:24,509
Insubordination to a uniformed officer,
of the law, no less.

687
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:26,009
Me!

688
01:07:26,339 --> 01:07:27,509
Wait.

689
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:29,389
Why are you not on your planet?

690
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:36,559
- Why are you so small?
- Because I'm a child.

691
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:41,939
That is absolutely not allowed here.

692
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:45,609
- Let's go!
- Hey! Hey!

693
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:48,869
Not so fast!

694
01:07:56,249 --> 01:07:58,209
Thank you. Thank you.

695
01:07:58,789 --> 01:08:00,879
That's right. Go on.

696
01:08:10,808 --> 01:08:12,598
We're gonna need a disguise.

697
01:08:33,328 --> 01:08:35,908
Excuse me. Excuse me.

698
01:08:35,998 --> 01:08:38,418
Sorry. Could I... Sir?

699
01:08:40,248 --> 01:08:42,128
Here are my subjects.

700
01:08:42,248 --> 01:08:43,498
Approach.

701
01:08:43,628 --> 01:08:45,008
Is that the King?

702
01:08:46,298 --> 01:08:47,758
- 67th floor.
- As you wish.

703
01:08:47,968 --> 01:08:49,298
- 27th floor.
- Granted.

704
01:08:49,428 --> 01:08:50,888
- 14th floor.
- Certainly.

705
01:08:50,968 --> 01:08:52,598
- 142nd floor.
- Of course.

706
01:08:52,678 --> 01:08:54,138
- 34th floor.
- Happily.

707
01:08:56,348 --> 01:08:57,848
No.

708
01:09:00,268 --> 01:09:02,518
Top floor, please.

709
01:09:04,358 --> 01:09:06,278
What? Top floor?

710
01:09:07,358 --> 01:09:10,108
When conditions are favourable?

711
01:09:10,278 --> 01:09:11,488
Your Majesty?

712
01:09:13,867 --> 01:09:15,197
Well...

713
01:09:16,497 --> 01:09:19,537
Conditions are favourable.

714
01:09:22,287 --> 01:09:23,707
It is done.

715
01:09:46,897 --> 01:09:47,817
There he is!

716
01:09:54,867 --> 01:09:56,867
Little Prince! Little Prince!

717
01:09:57,497 --> 01:09:58,497
What?

718
01:10:01,867 --> 01:10:03,497
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm okay.

719
01:10:05,207 --> 01:10:06,247
Oh, my chin.

720
01:10:06,667 --> 01:10:08,757
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

721
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:12,677
I was just... I was just taking
a little break, that's all.

722
01:10:13,177 --> 01:10:14,717
I thought you were someone else.

723
01:10:14,886 --> 01:10:15,926
You did?

724
01:10:16,886 --> 01:10:19,176
That's great! That's great.

725
01:10:19,886 --> 01:10:21,176
Please don't report me.

726
01:10:21,266 --> 01:10:23,686
Break's over. See? I'm working.

727
01:10:25,106 --> 01:10:26,686
Work, work, work.

728
01:10:27,016 --> 01:10:29,026
No need to report me.

729
01:10:29,356 --> 01:10:31,186
That wasn't him.

730
01:10:31,276 --> 01:10:33,026
What are we going to do now?

731
01:10:35,906 --> 01:10:37,366
Mr Prince?

732
01:10:40,706 --> 01:10:42,116
Can it be?

733
01:10:42,786 --> 01:10:43,866
Excuse me?

734
01:10:48,206 --> 01:10:49,706
Oh, man!

735
01:10:52,026 --> 01:10:53,526
I think you dropped this.

736
01:10:54,646 --> 01:10:55,816
My badge!

737
01:10:56,726 --> 01:10:59,556
- Oh, catastrophe.
- It is him.

738
01:11:00,106 --> 01:11:02,476
- Can I...
- What happened to you?

739
01:11:02,566 --> 01:11:04,236
Give me that. Please.

740
01:11:04,356 --> 01:11:06,276
The Aviator's not going to like this.

741
01:11:06,696 --> 01:11:09,486
- Give it!
- You're not supposed to be like this.

742
01:11:09,576 --> 01:11:11,406
Come on, give me that!

743
01:11:11,736 --> 01:11:13,196
Thank you.

744
01:11:14,706 --> 01:11:16,956
How does this work?

745
01:11:17,785 --> 01:11:20,035
I'm working. See? I'm being essential.

746
01:11:20,125 --> 01:11:22,545
- Wait, stop!
- No, don't talk to me.

747
01:11:22,625 --> 01:11:23,955
I know who you are!

748
01:11:24,045 --> 01:11:26,205
You're the Little Prince,
and you're afraid of baobabs!

749
01:11:26,255 --> 01:11:29,045
No... I'm Mr Prince,
the maintenance man.

750
01:11:29,135 --> 01:11:30,755
I'm afraid of the Businessman.

751
01:11:30,885 --> 01:11:33,265
You met an aviator in the desert,
he drew you a sheep!

752
01:11:33,385 --> 01:11:34,765
You ask too many questions!

753
01:11:34,955 --> 01:11:36,885
You also traveled
with a flock of migrating birds.

754
01:11:36,975 --> 01:11:39,555
Go away. Excuse me! I am very busy.

755
01:11:40,275 --> 01:11:42,865
You tamed a fox. A fox like him!

756
01:11:43,145 --> 01:11:44,275
Never had a pet.

757
01:11:44,395 --> 01:11:47,315
He wasn't your pet, he was your friend.

758
01:11:47,665 --> 01:11:50,085
Does it look like I have time for friends?

759
01:11:50,215 --> 01:11:51,335
I'm working!

760
01:11:53,385 --> 01:11:54,505
No!

761
01:11:56,055 --> 01:11:57,675
That was my last brush!

762
01:11:59,175 --> 01:12:00,845
I'm going to get fired.

763
01:12:01,265 --> 01:12:02,845
This was my last chance.

764
01:12:03,265 --> 01:12:06,765
This is so unfair!
I was just doing my job.

765
01:12:07,275 --> 01:12:09,935
- Actually, there's one more...
- Thank you.

766
01:12:10,235 --> 01:12:12,275
- Now I have to get back to work.
- Wait!

767
01:12:12,355 --> 01:12:14,865
You know what?
You're slowing down my productivity!

768
01:12:15,025 --> 01:12:17,275
You had a rose!

769
01:12:18,115 --> 01:12:19,194
A what?

770
01:12:19,444 --> 01:12:20,534
A rose.

771
01:12:20,954 --> 01:12:23,864
A really beautiful one. Miraculous even.

772
01:12:24,204 --> 01:12:26,204
One that was unique in all the world.

773
01:12:27,544 --> 01:12:30,084
You know, I've heard
quite enough of this nonsense.

774
01:12:30,254 --> 01:12:31,874
I have to work. Thank you.

775
01:12:31,964 --> 01:12:34,374
You've forgotten everything!

776
01:12:34,464 --> 01:12:36,714
I'm very busy. I have responsibilities.

777
01:12:36,804 --> 01:12:38,384
You've become just another grown-up!

778
01:12:38,714 --> 01:12:39,764
Give me that.

779
01:12:43,724 --> 01:12:44,764
No!

780
01:12:51,314 --> 01:12:53,144
Why did you do that?

781
01:12:53,564 --> 01:12:55,234
Why did you do...

782
01:12:56,774 --> 01:12:59,074
It's all right, I don't need to cry.

783
01:12:59,444 --> 01:13:02,324
I don't need to cry.
I'm a grown-up.  I'm a grown man.

784
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:08,084
My brushes got knocked over.
I don't need  to cry...

785
01:13:09,334 --> 01:13:11,414
I don't need  to cry...

786
01:13:19,844 --> 01:13:21,094
Blow.

787
01:13:25,803 --> 01:13:28,013
Wait a minute, why are you so short?

788
01:13:28,973 --> 01:13:30,853
- Are you really old?
- What?

789
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:33,523
No! I'm a child.

790
01:13:33,773 --> 01:13:35,603
Just like you're supposed to be.

791
01:13:35,693 --> 01:13:37,193
You're a child?

792
01:13:37,943 --> 01:13:40,963
Children are certainly very, very, very odd.

793
01:13:41,993 --> 01:13:43,113
This is not good.

794
01:13:44,113 --> 01:13:45,953
I think I know someone who can help.

795
01:13:49,663 --> 01:13:51,623
Are you sure about this?

796
01:14:01,383 --> 01:14:02,963
Mr Prince,

797
01:14:03,383 --> 01:14:05,673
what a pleasant surprise.

798
01:14:09,143 --> 01:14:11,183
This child needs your help.

799
01:14:11,313 --> 01:14:12,973
Does she?

800
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:18,653
Here, we don't
normally allow little dogs.

801
01:14:19,153 --> 01:14:22,573
But for you,
we will make an exception, won't we?

802
01:14:24,822 --> 01:14:26,032
Delightful.

803
01:14:26,152 --> 01:14:28,662
Come in, come in!

804
01:14:30,582 --> 01:14:33,492
So how have you been? Things good?

805
01:14:33,832 --> 01:14:35,582
I love my job cleaning the roof.

806
01:14:35,662 --> 01:14:37,872
Wonderful, wonderful.

807
01:14:47,012 --> 01:14:50,342
- Anything inessential...
- Must be made essential.

808
01:14:50,432 --> 01:14:52,392
Well done, Mr Prince.

809
01:14:55,772 --> 01:15:00,812
You see, it's really a magnificent thing
the Businessman has created here.

810
01:15:00,902 --> 01:15:03,862
You might even call it a work of art.

811
01:15:04,532 --> 01:15:06,742
But of course, you'd be wrong.

812
01:15:06,862 --> 01:15:09,362
Very wrong.

813
01:15:09,862 --> 01:15:11,532
Nothing so trivial as that.

814
01:15:11,622 --> 01:15:12,702
My plane!

815
01:15:12,782 --> 01:15:16,872
It's much more important.
Much more essential.

816
01:15:18,622 --> 01:15:20,122
No! Wait!

817
01:15:20,212 --> 01:15:22,132
How could you?
You said you would help.

818
01:15:22,212 --> 01:15:23,382

01:15:23,462 --> 01:15:25,052
I am. That's how they helped me!

820
01:15:27,301 --> 01:15:29,091
Mr Prince!

821
01:15:29,221 --> 01:15:32,221
It seems that
you've finally done something...

822
01:15:34,811 --> 01:15:36,391
(Let go.)
...right.

823
01:15:38,101 --> 01:15:40,891
You'll tell the Businessman?
How essential I've been?

824
01:15:41,101 --> 01:15:43,731
Yes, I most certainly will.

825
01:15:45,781 --> 01:15:47,781
The Businessman told me about

826
01:15:47,901 --> 01:15:51,241
this evidence of childhood
you brought with you.

827
01:15:51,321 --> 01:15:53,911
- Please! Those are important!
- No!

828
01:15:53,991 --> 01:15:55,991
There is nothing essential in here at all.

829
01:15:59,461 --> 01:16:00,831
It is time

830
01:16:01,921 --> 01:16:02,961
to grow up.

831
01:16:03,171 --> 01:16:06,751
THE ESSENTIAL GUIDE
TO EVERYTHING ESSENTIAL

832
01:16:07,841 --> 01:16:10,671
How could everything essential
fit into just one book?

833
01:16:10,931 --> 01:16:12,931
It is incredibly succinct.

834
01:16:13,591 --> 01:16:14,851
And single-spaced.

835
01:16:15,601 --> 01:16:19,931
So what?  I'm supposed to read this
over and over and over, until I'm old?

836
01:16:20,271 --> 01:16:21,141
Not at all.

837
01:16:21,851 --> 01:16:26,441
Here, we take a more
accelerated approach to growing up.

838
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:31,700
Isn't that right, Mr Prince?

839
01:16:31,860 --> 01:16:33,700
No, never mind.

840
01:16:33,780 --> 01:16:37,200
Those blank eyes,
you've forgotten everything, haven't you?

841
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:47,880
Now, you're going to feel a slight pinch.
Just relax.

842
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:50,130
Yes! Please sign there.

843
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:52,760
Standard consent form releasing myself,
the Businessman,

844
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:55,090
- and the corporation from all liability...
- Help!

845
01:16:55,180 --> 01:16:56,640
In case of accidental death

846
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,470
or dismemberment during
the centralizing process.

847
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:01,680
I'm trying to help you!

848
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:04,480
You're going to make
a wonderful grown-up.

849
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:07,810
Leave them!

850
01:17:10,650 --> 01:17:12,740
I said, leave them!

851
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,070
Act your age, Mr Prince!

852
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:18,580
Remember, you are
a graduate of my class.

853
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:23,250
Stop! What do you think you're doing?

854
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:31,550
Return to your desk, please.

855
01:17:40,099 --> 01:17:42,099
I didn't think that through.

856
01:17:42,729 --> 01:17:45,599
The Businessman
is going to be very disappointed in me.

857
01:17:46,019 --> 01:17:48,689
Thank you. But why?

858
01:17:49,519 --> 01:17:52,479
I never knew what this was,
or where I even got it,

859
01:17:52,569 --> 01:17:54,949
but I thought maybe it was important...

860
01:17:55,779 --> 01:17:56,819
Your sheep!

861
01:17:56,909 --> 01:17:58,279
My sheep?

862
01:17:59,739 --> 01:18:00,739
I don't get it.

863
01:18:01,079 --> 01:18:02,789
The Aviator gave it to you

864
01:18:02,869 --> 01:18:05,289
in the desert on Earth,
to eat the baobabs.

865
01:18:05,789 --> 01:18:07,789
- Catastrophe.
- Catastrophe.

866
01:18:08,129 --> 01:18:09,209
That's right.

867
01:18:09,459 --> 01:18:11,589
The Aviator drew all of these for you.

868
01:18:12,049 --> 01:18:16,049
- He really needs you right now.
- Me? He needs me?

869
01:18:19,389 --> 01:18:23,309
Growing up is not the problem.
Forgetting is.

870
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:28,649
I have an idea.

871
01:18:29,099 --> 01:18:31,429
We're just gonna need... My plane!

872
01:18:34,868 --> 01:18:35,908
There it is!

873
01:18:36,748 --> 01:18:38,118
It's okay.

874
01:18:45,378 --> 01:18:46,548
Hurry!

875
01:19:12,778 --> 01:19:14,618
We did it!

876
01:19:19,748 --> 01:19:21,078
Oh, no!

877
01:19:26,498 --> 01:19:27,748
Which button?

878
01:19:33,928 --> 01:19:35,098
No, no, no...

879
01:20:02,207 --> 01:20:03,287
Yes!

880
01:20:04,827 --> 01:20:07,457
We can catch it on top of the next pile!

881
01:20:07,797 --> 01:20:09,797
Wait, where's Mr Prince?

882
01:20:21,227 --> 01:20:22,517
I remember these.

883
01:20:23,517 --> 01:20:25,307
The stars.

884
01:20:25,397 --> 01:20:26,977
What are they all doing here?

885
01:20:33,697 --> 01:20:36,487
Look at the stars.
The stars are beautiful...

886
01:20:36,567 --> 01:20:38,407
The stars are beautiful

887
01:20:38,487 --> 01:20:41,326
because of a flower
that cannot be seen.

888
01:20:42,906 --> 01:20:45,826
Because of a flower
that cannot be seen?

889
01:20:46,036 --> 01:20:47,206
Your rose!

890
01:20:47,586 --> 01:20:50,086
I have a rose...

891
01:20:51,006 --> 01:20:53,586
I see you've found my collection,

892
01:20:53,666 --> 01:20:58,886
501,622,731 stars.

893
01:20:59,756 --> 01:21:02,056
You? You did this?

894
01:21:02,176 --> 01:21:04,226
But you're supposed
to just count the stars.

895
01:21:04,516 --> 01:21:09,106
Own! Say it with me.
Own. I own the stars.

896
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:13,436
Thank you. Thank you.

897
01:21:14,946 --> 01:21:18,526
They used to be merely
little golden objects in the sky

898
01:21:18,616 --> 01:21:22,116
that set lazy men to idle dreaming.

899
01:21:22,536 --> 01:21:27,036
But now, the stars
have finally been made essential.

900
01:21:28,126 --> 01:21:29,416
Where did you get that?

901
01:21:29,417 --> 01:21:30,751
Oh...

902
01:21:30,776 --> 01:21:32,196
She's curious.

903
01:21:32,376 --> 01:21:34,376
Isn't that just like a child?

904
01:21:37,636 --> 01:21:38,676
Oh, no!

905
01:21:38,756 --> 01:21:39,796
Thank you.

906
01:21:39,886 --> 01:21:41,256
All right! Enough.

907
01:21:41,386 --> 01:21:43,555
- Thank you.
- All right!

908
01:21:44,425 --> 01:21:45,725
Enough!

909
01:21:48,095 --> 01:21:50,895
What are you going to do
with all the stars?

910
01:21:50,975 --> 01:21:53,565
Don't worry, my little girl.

911
01:21:53,645 --> 01:21:55,985
I put the stars to good use.

912
01:22:14,415 --> 01:22:19,005
There. You see? The inessential has
become perfectly essential.

913
01:22:19,675 --> 01:22:22,095
How it should be for all things.

914
01:22:22,595 --> 01:22:23,925
Take her back to the classroom.

915
01:22:24,015 --> 01:22:25,765
Make sure no one interferes.

916
01:22:26,515 --> 01:22:29,265
- No! Put me down. I can't...
- Stop!

917
01:22:29,515 --> 01:22:32,265
- Don't let them do this to me.
- I said stop.

918
01:22:32,975 --> 01:22:34,605
- Wait.
- Wait?

919
01:22:35,315 --> 01:22:38,025
I've given you 371 jobs,

920
01:22:38,105 --> 01:22:41,155
and you have been fired
from 370 of them.

921
01:22:41,275 --> 01:22:44,944
I think it's time you get back to work,
my little failure.

922
01:22:45,944 --> 01:22:47,744
No! Leave him!

923
01:22:47,824 --> 01:22:49,284
Stop wriggling.

924
01:22:50,624 --> 01:22:52,124
Stop!

925
01:22:52,494 --> 01:22:55,124
- Take your hands off her.
- What? Stop?

926
01:22:55,794 --> 01:22:58,464
I'm not a failure. I'm...

927
01:22:58,834 --> 01:22:59,964
I'm the Little Prince.

928
01:23:00,214 --> 01:23:01,124
What?

929
01:23:02,544 --> 01:23:06,384
He thinks he's little, and a prince!

930
01:23:10,104 --> 01:23:11,384
Wonderful.

931
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:13,864
Look at me! I'm a bumble bee.

932
01:23:13,954 --> 01:23:16,494
What are you? A duck?

933
01:23:21,834 --> 01:23:23,084
He's hopeless.

934
01:23:24,674 --> 01:23:27,584
I'm not hopeless, I'm hope-full!

935
01:23:28,344 --> 01:23:30,754
That's right! I'm full of hope!

936
01:23:31,674 --> 01:23:33,174
And I love a rose!

937
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:35,634
And she loves me,
and she is waiting for me!

938
01:23:36,094 --> 01:23:37,514
So...

939
01:23:37,604 --> 01:23:39,434
I don't think I want to work
for you any more.

940
01:23:40,014 --> 01:23:41,434
So...

941
01:23:42,524 --> 01:23:43,604
I quit!

942
01:23:47,653 --> 01:23:49,443
I quit!

943
01:23:56,993 --> 01:23:57,953
That pile!

944
01:24:02,503 --> 01:24:05,963
When are you going to forget about
being a child?

945
01:24:06,623 --> 01:24:07,673
Never!

946
01:24:10,463 --> 01:24:11,633
Sorry, Mr Prince!

947
01:24:12,053 --> 01:24:15,473
No, no. It's my fault.
My face shouldn't have been there.

948
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:16,723
Good.

949
01:24:24,983 --> 01:24:26,063
No.

950
01:24:30,823 --> 01:24:32,073
I'm scared.

951
01:24:48,672 --> 01:24:50,082
Hang on!

952
01:25:00,932 --> 01:25:03,102
- I'll be right back!
- Where are you going?

953
01:25:03,532 --> 01:25:05,122
What are you doing?

954
01:25:06,772 --> 01:25:08,192
That's not good.

955
01:25:16,572 --> 01:25:19,952
I will grow up, but I'll never
be a grown-up like you!

956
01:25:33,132 --> 01:25:34,212
Wow!

957
01:25:51,561 --> 01:25:52,601
No!

958
01:25:59,951 --> 01:26:01,071
Got you!

959
01:26:11,291 --> 01:26:12,331
I got you, too.

960
01:26:41,531 --> 01:26:42,861
Wonderful.

961
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:57,200
This is very, very, very bad for business.

962
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:01,140
That...

963
01:27:01,164 --> 01:27:03,164
...was amazing!

964
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:07,810
The stars are back.

965
01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:11,940
I forgot how beautiful they are.

966
01:27:13,650 --> 01:27:17,570
- Look! Asteroid 325!
- You're remembering!

967
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,280
And 326!

968
01:27:20,620 --> 01:27:22,290
And 327!

969
01:27:22,830 --> 01:27:23,910
And 328!

970
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,620
It's working!

971
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:29,540
Look! B-612!

972
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:33,050
The baobabs.

973
01:27:38,850 --> 01:27:40,850
Your rose! She's there!

974
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:43,140
Hold on!

975
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,480
You're not going to try and land,
are you?

976
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:50,480
No, stop! Turn around! Stop!

977
01:27:58,819 --> 01:28:00,069
What's happening?

978
01:28:00,659 --> 01:28:02,989
I think we're falling.

979
01:28:05,829 --> 01:28:07,829
- Where are you going now?
- Sit still.

980
01:28:31,519 --> 01:28:32,609
Let's go.

981
01:28:54,049 --> 01:28:55,879
Over here! I found her!

982
01:29:01,758 --> 01:29:02,838
Look.

983
01:29:04,218 --> 01:29:05,428
My rose.

984
01:29:14,398 --> 01:29:15,728
It's her.

985
01:29:45,218 --> 01:29:46,258
No...

986
01:29:55,308 --> 01:29:56,768
No, how can this be?

987
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:03,607
I'm so sorry.

988
01:30:05,827 --> 01:30:07,617
You're supposed to be with her.

989
01:30:12,077 --> 01:30:14,287
I'm going to lose him, too.

990
01:30:17,127 --> 01:30:18,587
And grow up.

991
01:30:20,167 --> 01:30:21,667
And forget all about him.

992
01:30:24,177 --> 01:30:25,837
Forget everything

993
01:30:26,257 --> 01:30:27,597
forever.

994
01:30:30,017 --> 01:30:32,137
I don't want to lose him.

995
01:30:34,017 --> 01:30:35,097
Don't cry.

996
01:30:39,147 --> 01:30:41,317
How can you not be crying?

997
01:31:12,386 --> 01:31:13,806
I can see her.

998
01:31:21,026 --> 01:31:23,316
She was not a common rose.

999
01:31:24,316 --> 01:31:27,696
She was the only one of her kind
in the whole universe.

1000
01:31:30,326 --> 01:31:31,906
I remember her.

1001
01:31:32,366 --> 01:31:33,996
I remember all of it.

1002
01:31:34,536 --> 01:31:35,706
She's not gone.

1003
01:31:36,706 --> 01:31:37,826
She's still here?

1004
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:42,826
It is only with the heart
that one can see rightly.

1005
01:31:47,546 --> 01:31:49,216
He'll always be with me.

1006
01:31:50,886 --> 01:31:52,556
I understand now.

1007
01:32:05,855 --> 01:32:09,065
- Please tell the Aviator I remember him!
- I will!

1008
01:32:09,905 --> 01:32:11,115
Don't forget.

1009
01:32:11,445 --> 01:32:12,615
I won't!

1010
01:32:12,735 --> 01:32:15,405
I won't forget any of it! I promise.

1011
01:32:51,905 --> 01:32:53,025
Sweetie?

1012
01:32:53,115 --> 01:32:54,155
Yes?

1013
01:32:54,905 --> 01:32:57,115
- We're late.
- What?

1014
01:32:57,575 --> 01:32:58,615
No, we're not.

1015
01:32:58,785 --> 01:33:01,115
We need to stop by the hospital
before school.

1016
01:33:06,295 --> 01:33:10,794
122, 123, 124...

1017
01:33:13,134 --> 01:33:14,674
Okay.

1018
01:34:18,363 --> 01:34:19,693
You're here.

1019
01:34:22,533 --> 01:34:23,573
I'm sorry.

1020
01:34:24,873 --> 01:34:27,493
I'm so sorry for what I said.

1021
01:34:29,703 --> 01:34:31,873
I don't even remember.

1022
01:34:33,373 --> 01:34:34,423
That's sweet.

1023
01:34:34,543 --> 01:34:38,173
No, I don't even remember who you are.

1024
01:34:40,383 --> 01:34:43,173
I got you, didn't I?

1025
01:34:47,433 --> 01:34:49,723
I've got something to show you.

1026
01:35:05,203 --> 01:35:06,573
You did this?

1027
01:35:13,412 --> 01:35:16,252
All my drawings, all in order?

1028
01:35:20,632 --> 01:35:23,092
This is so wonderful.

1029
01:35:28,972 --> 01:35:30,432
Sweetheart.

1030
01:35:32,892 --> 01:35:37,442
"You run the risk of weeping a little,
if you let yourself get tamed."

1031
01:35:43,822 --> 01:35:46,992
You're going to make
a wonderful grown-up.

1032
01:35:56,252 --> 01:35:57,752
Thank you.

1033
01:35:59,632 --> 01:36:01,132
Did you see this?

1034
01:36:08,112 --> 01:36:09,702
It's wonderful.

1035
01:36:09,862 --> 01:36:12,202
Look. You see? That's the fox.

1036
01:36:13,072 --> 01:36:14,452
My fox.

1037
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:37,490
The End.

1038
01:38:33,669 --> 01:38:36,929
You probably think
this is a hat, but it's not.
