# CAS_project
CAS is short for Citiation Adaptation Search
CAS is a package that has the modules and methods that can take book citiations
and return a book adaptation movie part with that citiation said by a hero, or just the
seconds, when that citiation is said in the movie.
Also there are modules that can find the similar phrases between the book
and a movie based on that book and write them into a file.
There is a functioning media player in case you bought a film
and want to see the citiations played for you.

This package is very handy for people who like to read and watch movies
as it combines 2 pleasent things into one, also it can get people, who like
watching movies to read. Also the package can be used in schools by teachers
for teaching literature along with showing the adaptation.

In file example.py there is a good example of most of the modules and functions usage.
The file works really well with "The little prince" movie.
To get good use of the package you should have a txt file with the book text and an srt
file with the book adaptation subtitles. Also you can buy a movie to get the max out of
the package.
Package uses nltk, python-vlc, srt, pandas python modules and a VLC Video Player. Be careful with srt
module on windows, as it is a bit bugged.
If this information was not enough, check out each module for Google-style python documentation.
